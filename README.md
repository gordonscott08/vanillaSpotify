# Jams: Spotify Playlist Builder #

## Project Description ##
This site uses the [Spotify API](developer.spotify.com) to search for songs and build custom playlists that can then be saved to the user's Spotify account.
This project is written in vanilla JavaScript (hence the repo name) and as a next step I intend to build the same app in React.

## API Details ##
This project uses Spotify's [Authorization Code with PKCE Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-pkce-flow). I leaned heavily on the documentation for the authentation process.

## Attribution and Sources ##
Credit for the concept goes to Codecademy.com where course-takers are asked to create such an app in any manner they choose.
